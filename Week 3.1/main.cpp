/* 1. Arrays

Write a program that declares an array of 100 integers. Using a for loop populate the array with 100 integers where the nthâ€™s position of the array contains an integer which is the number n.

HINT: Remember that arrays being with index 0 and your for loop has to start with 0 and end with size-1 as its last position.

Repeat the exercise but create an array that can hold a 100 chars and populate each position in the char array with any char of your choosing. */
