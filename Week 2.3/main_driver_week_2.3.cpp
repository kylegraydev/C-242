/* 3. Write a program that computes loan repayments

for a loan based on simple interest and
for a loan  based on compound interest.
(You must use the * / + - operators)

Extend the program in (b) to print out the monthly repayment schedule and remaining balance

HINT: Use the ++ and â€“ and += and -= operators. */
